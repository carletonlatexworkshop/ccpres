% Template for Carleton student presentations

\documentclass{beamer}

% Beamer has facilities to format handouts and notes to go along with your slides,
% but we won't use them here.
\mode<presentation>

% Beamer comes with *lots* of themes. Boadilla is a nice choice;
% it's elegant and stays out of the way.
% Many of the standard themes are very busy, with tables of contents in the
% sidebar and other messiness. This is usually just a distraction for your audience.
% (If they're looking at the ToC, it's because they're bored!)
\usetheme{Boadilla}

% We then load in the custom Carleton color scheme.
\usecolortheme{carl}

% Finally, we load the style file, which sets up various things for us.
\usepackage{ccpres}

% The lxfonts package is a nice choice for a presentation.
% lmodern and arev are also good choices (but the latter looks a
% bit clunky with math).
\usepackage{lxfonts}

% Set your title and author data here.
% The optional arguments will be used in the running footer;
% simply remove them if you want to re-use the long versions.
\title[Short Title]{Long Title}
\author[A.~Name]{Author name}
\institute[Carleton]{Carleton College}
\date{Date}

\begin{document}

% Each slide goes in a frame environment.
% The first one should be your title page, which is
% set up automatically by Beamer.
\begin{frame}
  \titlepage

  \begin{center}
    If you want more text on the title, put it here.
  \end{center}
\end{frame}

% After that, go nuts!
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Title}
  Frame content here
